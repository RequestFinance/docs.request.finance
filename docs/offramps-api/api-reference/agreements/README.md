# Agreements

In order to make use of the service and its delivery partners, the user needs to agree to the terms and conditions.

Do do this, you can render the Agreement#Show endpoint in an iFrame. Upon completing the flow, an Javascript event will be emitted. You can capture this event to confirm the user has agreed to the terms.
