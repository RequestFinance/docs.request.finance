# Testing

To test the Request Finance API with your application, you can use your “Test” API key when making requests. You can find your “Test” API key in the ["Developer" tab](https://app.request.finance/account/api-keys) in “Settings”.&#x20;

Invoices that you create using your “Test” API key will be persisted on the Goerli Testnet (a testing network for Ethereum). You can see and interact with them in our sandbox: [https://baguette-app.request.finance/](https://baguette-app.request.finance/). Use your existing credentials to access your sandbox account.&#x20;

## Payments

To test paying an invoice or a payroll payment without spending real tokens, you can use ETH on Goerli Testnet. You can get some using a faucet online and your wallet address.&#x20;

Make sure to create invoices and payroll payments with ETH on Goerli as a payment method.&#x20;

Since the account that issued the invoice cannot be the account that pays the invoice, you will need to create another Request Finance account for the buyer role.

#### **Token Alternative**&#x20;

If you have trouble getting a lot of ETH to test with, you can also set up invoices and payroll payments using FAU on Goerli. You can mint some FAU tokens at [https://erc20faucet.com/](https://erc20faucet.com/).

## Postman Collection

You can find a Postman collection of the Request Finance API [here](https://www.postman.com/request-finance/workspace/request-finance-api-public/documentation/24913360-b5105a65-a6bd-4247-b3b1-ed60e5c8f5cb). Feel free to use it to test the API.&#x20;
