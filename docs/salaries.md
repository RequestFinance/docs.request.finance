# Payroll

Request Finance allows you to pay net salaries, bonuses, or token vestings to your employees with a couple of clicks. With the API, you can create salary payments from your own tool and pay them later via the Request Finance application.

On a technical level, a payroll payment is just another type of [invoice](invoices.md). As with invoices, payments also need to be converted to an on-chain request after they are created.

## Creating an Off-Chain Payroll Payment

Creating an off-chain payroll payment is done via the same [endpoint that is used to create invoices](invoices.md#creating-an-off-chain-invoice), but with some changes to the attributes (see below).

Note that while the endpoint uses the same attributes, they're handled differently in the Request Finance application. Notably:&#x20;

* `meta`: `format` must be `rnf_salary` to ensure that the salary payment shows up as such in the Request Finance application.
* A `sellerInfo` object is included that includes information about the employee to be paid.
* Some information can be omitted. Refer to the example request below.

#### **Example Request**

Letâ€™s assume you want to pay your employee, William Dean (william.dean@abc-unicorn.com), $1,000.00 using USDC on Polygon. Additionally, the salary should be created every month for the next three months.

To create a salary payment like this, you would pass the following body with the request:

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>{
</strong>  "meta": {
    "format": "rnf_salary",
    "version": "0.0.3"
  },
  "creationDate": "2023-05-31T14:59:59.999Z",
  "invoiceItems": [
    {
      "currency": "USD",
      "name": "Salary",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": "100002"
    }
  ],
  "invoiceNumber": "1",
  "buyerInfo": {
    "email": "joe.bloggs@abc-unicorn.com"
  },
  "sellerInfo": {
    "email": "william.dean@abc-unicorn.com",
    "firstName": "William",
    "lastName": "Dean"
  },
  "paymentTerms": {
    "dueDate": "2023-06-01T14:59:59.999Z"
  },
  "paymentOptions": [
        {
            "type": "wallet",
            "value": {
                "currencies": [
                    "USDC-matic"
                ],
                "paymentInformation": {
                    "paymentAddress": "0x4886E85E192cdBC81d42D89256a81dAb990CDD74",
                    "chain": "matic"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
  "recurringRule": "DTSTART:20230601T074619Z\nRRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=3"
}
</code></pre>

As with invoices, in the JSON response, you will get an `id` field. Please save it in a variable or in your database. You will need it to convert the payment into an on-chain request in the next section.

## Converting an Off-Chain Salary Payment into an On-Chain Request

Converting a salary payment to an on-chain request to make it payable is done using the same [endpoint that is used for invoices](invoices.md#converting-an-off-chain-invoice-into-an-on-chain-request). Replace `[id]` with the ID of the payment you saved previously. You donâ€™t need to pass anything in the request body.

## Paying a Salary Payment

The only way to currently pay an on-chain salary payment is via the Request Finance application. Simply log in to [Request Finance](https://app.request.finance/) and navigate to the ["Salaries" menu](https://app.request.finance/salaries) to make payments individually or in batch.

## Fetching a Salary Payment

To check the status of a salary payment and understand if it has been paid, please use the same [endpoint that is used for invoices](invoices.md#fetching-an-invoice). Replace `[id]` with the `requestId` of the Request (recommended), or the `invoiceId`.
